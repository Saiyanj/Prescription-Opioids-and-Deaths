# Prescription-Opioids-and-Deaths

Data from 2022, sourced from CMS and the CDC via Kaggle.com

Hi! I found some interesting datasets on Kaggle that were sourced from CMS and the CDC and I decided to clean up the data a bit and play around with it in Tableau.
The data from CMS is medication claims from Medicare Part D. I extracted the medications that were opioids and added up the amount of opioid claims there were per state.
In my visualization of the data I would like to make it clear that the opioid crisis in America is incredibly complicated and in no way am I making any claims about the causes of the crisis. I do however believe that the datasets are intersting when visualized together. The final visualization can be found at https://public.tableau.com/views/PrescriptionandOverdose/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.
I posted the code I used to clean up the data. I use MySQL and PopSQL.
Thank you for reading this far :)
